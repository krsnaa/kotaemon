libs/kotaemon appears to be the core library that provides the fundamental building blocks and components for creating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

Here's an overview of the main components and functionality:

- Base Components: The base folder contains core classes like BaseComponent, Document, and various message types (e.g., AIMessage, HumanMessage). These provide the foundational structures for the rest of the system.

- Loaders: The loaders folder contains various document loaders for different file types (PDF, Excel, HTML, etc.). These loaders handle the ingestion of different document formats into the system.

- Embeddings: The embeddings folder contains classes for generating embeddings, including wrappers for various embedding models and services.

- Storages: The storages folder includes implementations for document stores and vector stores, which are crucial for storing and retrieving documents and their embeddings.

- Indices: The indices folder contains classes for indexing and retrieving documents, including vector-based retrieval methods.

- LLMs (Language Models): The llms folder contains wrappers and interfaces for various language models, including OpenAI's GPT models and local models.

- Agents: The agents folder implements different types of agents, including ReAct and ReWOO paradigms, for complex reasoning and task-solving.

- Parsers and Extractors: The project includes various parsers and extractors for processing and extracting information from documents.

- Chatbots: There's a chatbot folder with implementations for chat-based interfaces.

- Utilities: Various utility functions and helper classes are scattered throughout the project.

- CLI: The project includes a command-line interface for various operations.

This structure suggests that kotaemon is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework for building RAG systems. It provides components for document ingestion, embedding generation, storage, retrieval, and interaction with language models. The modular design allows for easy customization and extension of various components.

The project seems to integrate with popular libraries and services in the AI/ML ecosystem, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, and Azure AI services, while also providing its own implementations and abstractions.

On the other hand, ktem appears to be an application built on top of kotaemon. It likely provides:

A specific implementation of a RAG system using kotaemon components
A user interface (web-based, using Gradio)
Configuration and settings management (via flowsettings.py)
Integration of various kotaemon components into a cohesive application
Additional features like user management, conversation history, etc.

The relationship between kotaemon and ktem seems to be:

kotaemon is the core library providing the building blocks
ktem is an application that uses kotaemon to create a full-fledged RAG system with a user interface

This separation allows for:

Reusability: The core kotaemon library can be used to build different RAG applications, not just ktem.
Modularity: New features can be added to ktem without necessarily changing the core kotaemon library.
Abstraction: ktem can provide a higher-level interface to the user, hiding the complexity of the underlying kotaemon components.

In summary, kotaemon is the engine, while ktem is a specific vehicle built using that engine. This architecture allows for flexibility in development and deployment of RAG systems.
